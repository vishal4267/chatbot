# chatbot
This is a basic rule-based chatbot built using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. It uses predefined regex patterns and reflections to carry out simple text-based conversations. The chatbot can respond to greetings, tell you its name, and even remember your name during the chat session.
